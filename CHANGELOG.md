# Changelog

## [0.1.2] - 16 July 2025
- Added deduplication logic to all paginated 'get many' operations in `mauticApiRequestAllItems` to ensure unique records are returned for all resources (contacts, companies, campaigns, tags, etc.).
- This fix prevents duplicate output records when the Mautic API returns overlapping data across pages.

## [0.1.1]
- Original release.
